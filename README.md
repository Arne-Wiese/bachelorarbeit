## The missing link: On hierarchies from multiple subspaces to single subspace optimized clustering
In the setting of high-dimensional clustering, a sub-taxonomy exists differentiating between clusters that reside in a single common arbitrarily oriented subspace (SSO clustering) and clusters that reside in multiple arbitrarily oriented subspaces (MSO clustering). While there exists in the literature a plethora of methods for either archetype, they are regarded in a binary fashion as “its either SSO or MSO clustering” in two disjoint categories. We challenge this circumstance by investigating transitions between both worlds in a hierarchical fashion. In this thesis, we will together discover the properties of bridging both worlds (MSO and SSO). The tasks are to implement and evaluate a prototype of this concept.
